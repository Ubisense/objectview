# ObjectView

This is the Ubisense ObjectView javascript client side library.

ObjectView allows client applications to access and subscribe to changes in the Ubisense SmartSpaceÂ® data model. ObjectView is based on [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR), and this library is a simple wrapper around the SignalR client to make it easy to subscribe to defined views.

Full documentation of ObjectView is currently maintained on [Ubisense Docs](docs.ubisense.com).

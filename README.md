# ObjectView

This is the Ubisense ObjectView javascript client side library.  ObjectView allows client
applications to access and subscribe to changes in the Ubisense SmartSpaceÂ® data model.  ObjectView
is based on SignalR, and this library is a simple wrapper around the SignalR methods to make it easy
to subscribe to defined views.
